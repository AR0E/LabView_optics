Suppose we have $n$ points $accent(bold(x), ->) in bb(R)^m$ arranged 
as $[bold(A)]_{m n}$ and we want to _interpolate_ a curve 
$gamma : [a,b] -> bb(R)^m$ through them. We may perform any of the number
of different parametric interpolations such as _linear, polynomial, non-linear_
and the likes.
